Well, it's finally here, the MCU shows we were promised over a year ago are now a reality, with WandaVision an interesting choice to lead the way. I had heard that it was going to play with the old school sitcom aesthetic, but I had my doubts that it would go too far down the rabbit hole. After, as good as the MCU is, they've always played it pretty safe when it comes to genre bending. We were told in the past things like Winter Soldier would be a "political thriller" and Ant Man a "heist" film, but they both wound up being pretty conventional superhero movies. That isn't itself a bad thing, but it left me with doubts that Marvel would ever produce something outlandish, inventive, and unique. WandaVision has put those doubts to rest, as it fully embraces the delightful absurdity of its premise and the quirks of its lead characters. Borrowing tropes from classic sitcoms, it acts as a bizarrely amusing scenario of two fantastical superheroes living the quiet suburban life of 1950s picket fence America, while also implying that something off, and potentially sinister, is going on behind the scenes. Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany brilliantly chew the scenery, with Olsen's adorable attempts to be a ditzy housewife a particular standout. I will say it's probably not for everyone, as younger fans unfamiliar with classic TV tropes unlikely to understand the parody, but if you want to see what is best described as Marvel's first truly unique live action endeavor, I highly recommend this series.
